# iTheon-Auto-Looter - v0.1.18

![Auto looter by Blackgrowl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35302307/216791072-fa553c9d-d205-4480-a506-b833aee55ed1.jpg)

Mod for Stalker Anomaly that adds the fully configurable (MCM config) auto-looting feature. Also allows you for remote looting (without opening a container).
It has a semi-hard requirement - https://github.com/lTheon/iTheon-Pick-Best-Disassembly-Tool . Technicaly you can play without this dependency, but you might experience some CTDs on disassembling large amount of items at once (just XRay stuff). This mod can be replaced with any other mod that prevents the full depletion of disassembly tools

Tested in both GAMMA and vanilla Anomaly. To get all you can out of it, you'll need two other mods: <br>
https://github.com/ahuyn/anomaly-wpo <br>
https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/crafting-info-in-tooltips <br>
Or simply play GAMMA :)

Disassemble animations should be turned off to not cause CTDs/busy hands <br>
Things you can configure - disassembling items (different options per item type), stripping weapon parts and attachments, looting stuff, remote looting range, deleting items (get rid of piles of dead bodies).

Given a large amount of possible combinations, I'm pretty sure it's almost impossible for me to test everything myself, though a big chunk of time was spent on that anyway. That's why the initial version is set to **v0.1**, as there might be some minor bugs to fix that I did not catch.
